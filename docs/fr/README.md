# French B2B Requirements

The GitHub issues [40](<https://github.com/svanteschubert/complex-business-cases/issues/40>) to [77](https://github.com/svanteschubert/complex-business-cases/issues/77) are created based on the B2B requirements of French taken from <https://www.impots.gouv.fr/specifications-externes-b2b>.

1. The folder "Dossier de spécifications externes de la facturation électronique, annexes et swaggers" is basically representing the unpacked [ZIP file of version 2.3](https://www.impots.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/media/1_metier/2_professionnel/EV/2_gestion/290_facturation_electronique/specification_externes_b2b/dossier-de-specifications-externes-de-la-facturation-electronique-annexes-et-swaggers-v2.3.zip).
   * The text from GitHub issues are based on the case explaination from "Spécifications externes de la facturation électronique - Cas d'usage_v2.3.pdf" within the above ZIP, but transformed via DOCX to MarkDown (see 4)
   * In addition, the [PDF of version 2.2 of the use cases in English](https://www.impots.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/media/1_metier/2_professionnel/EV/2_gestion/290_facturation_electronique/specification_externes_b2b/version-english/external-specification-file-in-english_en_v31012023_vf.zip) was downloaded to use English pictures for the GitHub issues.
   * The English PDF and DOCX 2.3 versions were created by <https://www.deepl.com/translator/files>.
   * The English Markdown 2.3 version was created by <https://products.aspose.app/words/conversion/docx-to-md>.

2. The PDF "2023 10 23 - Extension for France B2B Mandate.pdf" is a summary of Cyrille Sautereau

3. The spreadsheet "20231023_EN16931-EXTENDED-CTC-FR.xlsx" is a subset of one of the appendix spreadsheets of the initial folder with the EN16931 semantics as one of the first columns (edited by Cyrille and I just fixed column borders and moved semantic column further to the beginning).

4. The HTML "20231023_EN16931-EXTENDED-CTC-FR.html" was created with the LibreOffice export of HTML (with the latest version as I am the maintainer) and added IDs (via XSLT) to us the BT/BG numbers as fragment identifiers.
