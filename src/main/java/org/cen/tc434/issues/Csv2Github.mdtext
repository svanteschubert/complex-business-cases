# Csv2GitHub

## Purpose

Initialisation of this CEN-TC-434 repository from [the amendment list spreadsheet (CSV)](https://github.com/svanteschubert/CEN-TC-434/blob/master/src/test/resources/issues/EN%2016931%20amendment%20topics%20list.csv). Creating [CEN/TC 434 issues](https://github.com/svanteschubert/CEN-TC-434/issues) including our specific [labels](   https://github.com/svanteschubert/CEN-TC-434/labels) and [milestones](https://github.com/svanteschubert/CEN-TC-434/milestones).

**NOTE**: *Whenever a label/milestone is chosen, all related issues are being listed. [More advanced search](https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-label) is possible.*

## Prerequisition

* Java 11
* Saving the amendment list spreadsheet to a [comma separated value text file](https://github.com/svanteschubert/CEN-TC-434/blob/master/src/test/resources/issues/EN%2016931%20amendment%20topics%20list.csv)
* (New) private GitHub repository - where the new issues are being created into:
    Adjust the [REPO_NAME](https://github.com/svanteschubert/CEN-TC-434/blob/master/src/main/java/org/cen/tc434/issues/Github.java#L39) variable using your repository.
* GitHub API access is provided by your GitHub "personal access" token in a "~/.github" file, for instance:

```javascript
login=your-github-loginname
oauth=your-personal-access-token-01234567890abcdefgh
```

**NOTE**: *You should create yourself a new "personal access token" with sufficent access rights under:*
    *see https://github.com/settings/apps *
    *Login GitHub -> upper right corner -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> "personal access token"*

## How to trigger the generation

Call from a commandline in the root directory of the repository: "gradlew build run"

## How it works

1. The build system Gradle is executing the [main class "Csv2Github.java"](https://github.com/svanteschubert/CEN-TC-434/blob/master/src/main/java/org/cen/tc434/issues/Csv2Github.java).
2. The CSV is being parsed line by line by the ["Csv.java" class](https://github.com/svanteschubert/CEN-TC-434/blob/master/src/main/java/org/cen/tc434/issues/Csv.java).
3. GitHub is accssed via the ["Github.java" class](https://github.com/svanteschubert/CEN-TC-434/blob/master/src/main/java/org/cen/tc434/issues/Github.java) taking advantage of the [Java GitHub API of Kohsuke Kawaguchi](https://github-api.kohsuke.org/).
